Parkinson’s disease impairs mobility due to the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra, resulting in tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. This project introduces a non-invasive neurotechnology that predicts motor intentions using a multimodal transformer-model trained on EEG , EMG, and IMU data from both me and my father, who is diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. EEG were collected from a homebuilt EEG-circuit and donated equipment by OpenBCI. A homebuilt 6-axis robot arm from Arduino serves as proof-of-concept, controlled in real time by biosignal driven predic-tions. Future iterations may bypass the damaged nervous system entirely using FUS and EMS to enable voluntary movement in Parkinson’s patients once again.
