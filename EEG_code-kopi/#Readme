These files contain the original scripts and coding for the NucleoSTM3F303K8 board, with settings to measure from three active electrodes
placed above the scalpe at C3, C4 and Cz. I've since changed the Nucleo board to a Teensy 4.1 board, meaning these files are no longer in use. 
Furthermore, is the EEG-circuit replaced with professional equpiment sponsored by OpenBCI, to ensure more precise data acquistion.
